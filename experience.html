                        <h6><b>Introduction</b></h6>
                        <p>     When I was eight years old, my family moved from Buffalo, New York to beautiful St. George, Utah. My family consisted of my Father and Mother, me (being the oldest), my sister, and my two younger brothers. My dad is 6'4" tall, however he didn't grow until he was allmost 20 years old. He thought we would follow a similar path of growth and knew we would be too small to play football or basketball or really any popular sports. It was also too hot in St. George to play outside and so he thought that swimming would be the perfect idea. This is where my journey began.</p>
                        
                       <!--Center a Photo of St. George here-->

                        <h6><b>My Beginning</b></h6>
                        <p>     When I started swimming, my little sister was faster than me. I mostly did it during the summers because I was too young to do it competitvely with school and soccer was the way to go. When I turned 11, I joined the local club team; The Southern Utah Swimming Association Stingrays. I improved quickly but didn't really have much direction. I was still a growing, skinny kid who didn't know anything about dreams and goals. After I turned 12, I moved into a more advanced group with a Coach by the name of Shawn King. I was with a bunch of the older kids and wasn't much of a competition. That winter after I joined Shawns group, we were practicing outside in the freezing temperatures. We were complaining about how cold it was in the warm water and so Shawn made us get out and jump in the unheated kiddie pool. It was at that moment that I decided Shawn was too scary to be my coach and I was tall enough to play basketball so I quit.</p>

                        <h6><b>The Return</b></h6>
                        <p>     For a year and a half I played basketball and quickly discovered after my team ended the season with a 1-11 record that basketball wasn't my sport. I turned back to swimming a year a half before my freshman year. By this point, Coach Shawn had moved away and so I was willing to give it another shot. I progressed really quickly and by the time I was a freshman in High School, I made the varsity team and swam in the fastest lane. We practiced two times a day, everyday. The State Championship was set to take place in February and in January we got a pleasant surprise. Coach Shawn returned to coach in St. George and was placed in charge of my group... I was nervous to say the least. We turned a new page and started a friendship that would last forever. That year, under the direction of Coach Shawn, we lost the region championship by half a point and I placed 5th at state, something I was not expected to do.</p>
                        
                        <!--Center a Photo of the Region championship meet and maybe one of Shawn-->
                        
                        <h6>Goals</h6>
                        <p>     That next summer, Shawn came to me and placed a dream in my head of the things that I could accomplish. He told me I could qualify for the Olympic Trials meet for 2020, although I wasn't even close at the time. I believed him and did my best to follow his instructions and train as hard as I could. With his help, we formed the most dominant high school swim team in the history of the state of Utah. We broke all of the state records for the relay races, I didn't lose a race for almost 3 years, and the grind of practicing two times a day continued. I accomplished another dream of swimming in college by committing to swim for Brigham Young University. My senior year, I was within a second and a half of accomplishing this dream that originally I had no clue I could accomplish. I placed 19th in the nation in the 200 Freestyle and that summer, we geared up to hit the Olympic trial qualifying time. In practice, I was hitting my paces perfectly. We were set to leave on Thursday and I was in the best shape of my life. On Tuesday, we got the news that the meet had been cancelled. COVID-19 was in full force.</p>

                        <h6>The Pandemic and Setbacks</h6>
                        <p>     Once the world was thrown into shock from the new pandemic and all the pools shut down, I had no where to practice. Fortunately, this also meant that the Olympics and Olympic trials were to be cancelled or at least postponed to 2021. Unlike running, swimming isn't something you can just do. The only way to get better at swimming is to actually swim. I was terrified of the future and wasn't sure what to expect going into my freshman year at BYU. I needed to make an impression and solidify my spot on the team. School finally started and I had a place to train but the whole campus was in disarray as everyone was still trying to figure out what needed to be done. At the start of the season, I was one of the most in shape people on the team. Unlike others on the team who had looked at the pandemic as a reason to take a break from training, I did my best to run with an elevation mask, lift weights, and eat right. Training with BYU continued until halfway through the month of September where the entire team was required to quarantine for two whole weeks. This was two weeks that I couldn't leave my room. To make matters even worse, four days after I got out of quarantine, I tested positive for the dreaded disease. This required another two weeks in my room and another two weeks out of the pool. I felt as though I had lost all my progress. Despite this setback, I was determined to overcome and continue my goal of swimming.</p>

                        <h6>Championship Season</h6>
                        <p>    That winter, I took a chance and decided to try again for the Olympic trials qualifying time although I didn't feel like I was at 100% speed. I got my 100 backstroke under half a second from the qualifying time and knew that if I could get back to top speed then I could accomplish this dream that had been in the making for 4 years. The next big meet was conference and I killed it. I went multiple lifetime best times and ended up winning the 200 freestyle as an underdog. I was the only freshman from BYU to win an event! I felt so accomplished and satisfied and had swam my race perfectly. Time was running down to make the qualifying period and I knew I only had one more chance to make it. I travelled to Arizona and did my best. Due to some unfortunate complications within the race, I did not qualify for the Olympic Trials. I was heartbroken, however it didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.</p>

                        <h6>Lessons Learned</h6>
                        <p>     I think part of the reason I wasn't super disappointed in myself was because of how much I had accomplished up until that point. I had done things and won more races than I ever had imagined before Coach Shawn put the dream in my head. Having a goal as lofty as that pushed me and made me better than I could have been without it. I stretched, I worked, I pushed, I dreamed, I cried, I conquered, and I left my mark on history and my life. Swimming teaches you so much more than just how to go from one side of the pool to the other as fast as possible. I learned how to work hard on sets and practices that made me throw up.I learned how to manage my time between 4 hours of training a day and my family and school. I learned how to dream and stretch my vision to a higher plane. I know that as you dream bigger than you can imagine, and you work as hard as you can to accomplish that goal, not only will you enjoy moments along the way but you will also accomplish a lot more than you could have done otherwise. I know this.</p>
