                        <p>Although Swimming has taken up the majority of my life, especially during the school year, during summers I have taken various jobs that have provided me with experience, connections, and helped me create core values of hard work, excellence and effectiveness. Below, I share some of my prior occupations and some of the things that I learned along with past achievments outside of swim.</p>
